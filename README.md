# Claritas

**Claritas** is a collection of standalone Python tools for denoising PET images using SwinUNETR-based neural networks. It includes scripts for preprocessing `.nrrd` PET data, training models with or without tumor masks, and evaluating performance. The repository is designed for research purposes and does not depend on 3D Slicer.

## üß† Model Descriptions

| Filename                   | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `pet_denoiser_std_char.pth` | Trained with standard Charbonnier loss for general denoising. |
| `pet_denoiser_x19w1_5.pth` | Tumor-weighted loss model (1.5x penalty for underestimation). |
| `pet_denoiser_x14w3.pth`   | Strong tumor-focused model (3x weight for underestimation). |

## üõ†Ô∏è Script Descriptions

### `Claritas_Train_UI_single_wmasks.py`

GUI application for training PET denoising models **with tumor masks**.

**Features:**
- Supports SwinUNETR and UNet
- Custom loss functions (MSE, MAE, SSIM, tumor-weighted L1)
- Real-time training plots and logging
- Uses .npy files for training and validation
- The input files shold have be in pairs in seperate folders with exact same names

### `Claritas_Train_UI_single_nomask.py`
Same as above but for training without tumor segmentation masks.

### `batch_nrrd_to_npy_fullvol.py`
Resamples .nrrd PET files to 2√ó2√ó2 mm
Crops central 256√ó256 area
Saves full volumes as .npy

### `batch_nrrd_to_npy_gridpatch.py`
Extracts non-overlapping patches of size 64√ó64√ó64
Saves each patch as a separate .npy file
